## Configuration
`user_block_inventory.txt` refers to the block inventory everyone haves (as one of our value is to make everyone have the same blocks).
It defaults to the demo one which is limited. The hoster should change when possible.

`app_remote_configuration.json` is the remote configuration used by Blocksworld.

`new_world_id.txt`; `new_model_id.txt`; `new_account_id.txt` are the next world ID, model ID and account ID respectively, to be used and MUST NOT be changed manually.

`blocks_pricings.json` is the prices of the blocks on the Shop.

`coin_packs.json` are the available coin packs. Should not change as they are directly linked to Steam iAPs.

`content_categories.json` the content (world and models) available categories.
