## Setup
To setup the server, just clone the repository and setup things with `npm`.

Now you will need to create a directory called `cert` that will contain:
- `fullchain.pem`: The full chain of your certificate
- `privkey.key`: The private key of your certificate (it probably doesn't originally end in `.key`)
